# Mindset

When you have a **growth mindset** you understand that your abilities can be developed and, therefore, extra time and effort makes you stronger and can result in higher achievement.

<br/>

Opposite of this, a **fixed mindset** is when one believes that their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. They spend their time documenting their intelligence or talent instead of developing them. They also believe that talent alone creates success—without effort.

# Michael Jordan:

### “I've **missed** more than 9000 shots in my career. I've **lost** almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've **failed over and over and over again** in my life...

* # .. and that is why I **succeed**”
