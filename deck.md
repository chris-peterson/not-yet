# Dunning-Kruger effect

<!--  social psychologists -->
<!--  Kruger, Justin; Dunning, David (1999). "Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments" -->

## a cognitive bias in which people **overestimate** their competency

* ### caused by

  * lack of self-awareness
  * insufficient domain knowledge to have an accurate self-assessment
  aka _"you don't know what you don't know"_

# Taking the leap

## Requires

* Courage
* Patience
* Willingness to ~~fail~~ _learn_

# Courage

- ### Leaving the comfort of the known for the **unknown**
- ### Being **vulnerable**

# Two Mindsets

<style scoped>
  fixed {
    color: firebrick;
    font-weight: bold
  }
  growth {
    color: green;
    font-weight: bold
  }
</style>

![bg opacity:.1](resources/iStock-1226297372.jpg)

<fixed>fixed mindset</fixed>: belief that basic qualities, like intelligence or talent, are static attributes. Time is spent documenting intelligence or talent rather than developing capabilities.  Hard work and effort are eschewed as success is determined strictly from inherent ability.

<p></p>

<growth>growth mindset</growth>: belief that abilities can be developed and, therefore, extra time and effort results in increased skill.  Hard work is expected, and when it yields positive results, praised.

# Patience

## Learning takes **time**

![bg right fit](resources/iStock-1080392936-1.png)

---

## Learning is **non-linear**

![bg right fit](resources/iStock-1080392936-2.png)

---

## Everyone has a **unique path**

# Willingness to ~~fail~~ learn

Skill acquisition (particularly in technology) is often trial-and-error.

* Types of error feedback
  * linter / compiler
  * peer review
  * testing
  * bugs

## I've **missed** more than 9000 shots in my career
## I've **lost** almost 300 games
## 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed
## I've failed over and over and over again...
# and that is **why I succeed**

### - Michael Jordan
